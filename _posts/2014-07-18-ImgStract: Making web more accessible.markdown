alt: Extract Text from Image
description: "I build a tool that provides a solution to the lack
of alternative text of images in the web, specifically images that
contain text that is often ignored by developers and designers
when creating their web sites. Not adding correct alternative text
makes the web inaccessible to people with vision impairment who, when navigating the web, utilize screen
readers that speak out-loud the alternative text so that the user
can know what is happening in the images. This solution
comes in the form of a web app that allows users to upload
images and extract the text, if any, from it. Additionally, this tool
provides functionality for automatic language detection of
the text in the image and to translate the text to the desired
language. Results from evaluations and usability testings indicate that such a
tool is useful in making web more accessible."
