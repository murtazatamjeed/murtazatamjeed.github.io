description: "Despite increasing work investigating the accessibility of research tools, most accessibility research has tradi-
tionally focused on popular, mainstream, or web technologies. We investigated barriers and workarounds blind
and low vision doctoral students in computing-intensive disciplines experienced and engaged, respectively,
when using advanced technical tools for research tasks. We conducted an observation and interview study
with eight current and former Ph.D. students, closely analyzing the accessibility of specific tasks. Our findings
contextualize how inaccessible tools complicate research tasks, adding time and effort, and exacerbating
social entanglements in collaborative relationships. This work contributes empirical data that extricates how
in/accessibility of advanced technical tools used in research influence productivity and collegial efforts"
