alt: Accessibility vs. Usability
description: "I conducted observations and interviews with blind and low vision doctoral students to understand how they use advanced tools in their research and what technical and social challenges they encounter when conducting research. Preliminary findings indicate how inaccessible tools complicate research tasks, adding time and effort, and exacerbating social entanglement in collaborative relationships. Findings also indicate that usable designs can cause accessibility issues in programming and collaborative writing tools. As such, next I aim to conduct an in-depth analysis of the interplay between accessibility and usability of research tools. Previous arguments about the relationship between the two concepts are based on theoretical connections [6], and empirical tests are limited to government websites [7, 8]. In my work, I will test the relationship empirically through user studies, expert surveys, and guideline analysis, particularly for non-web advanced tools used in research. Through guideline analysis, I intend to find conflicting and overlapping areas between accessibility guidelines and usability heuristics, and understand how the guidelines apply to non-web advanced tools. Through accessibility expert surveys and interviews, I will investigate what practitioners think is the relationship between accessibility and usability, how designers and developers manage both types of issues, how the accessibility and usability of advanced tools are tested, and which accessibility and usability testing methods (e.g. automatic checking tools, conformance testing, user evaluation, expert inspection, etc.) work best for advanced tools.
