alt: Accessibility vs. Usability
description: "I conduct research to analyze the interplay between accessibility and usability of advanced tools. Previous arguments about the relationship between the two concepts are based on theoretical connections, and empirical tests are limited to government websites. In my work, I will test the relationship empirically through user studies, expert surveys, and guideline analysis, particularly for non-web advanced tools used in research. Through guideline analysis, I intend to find conflicting and overlapping areas between accessibility guidelines and usability heuristics, and understand how the guidelines apply to non-web advanced tools. Through accessibility expert surveys and interviews, I will investigate what practitioners think is the relationship between accessibility and usability, how designers and developers manage both types of issues, how the accessibility and usability of advanced tools are tested, and which accessibility and usability testing methods (e.g. automatic checking tools, conformance testing, user evaluation, expert inspection, etc.) work best for advanced tools.
